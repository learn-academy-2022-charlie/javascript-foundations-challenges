// Challenges
// IMPORTANT: Write the test FIRST, see it fail, then write the code to make it PASS.

// IMPORTANT: You do not need to comment out the old tests or functions. The purpose of tests are to be AUTOMATED. Commenting them out defeats that purpose.

// Write the test for a function that returns "drink coffee" if you are tired and "keep working" if you are not tired.


    // describe("areYouTired", () => {
    //     it("returns drink coffee or keep working based on input", () => {
    //     expect(areYouTired("yes")).toEqual("drink coffee")
    //     expect(areYouTired("no")).toEqual("keep working")
    //     })
    // })


// Write the function that will make the test pass.

            // const areYouTired = (string) => {
            //     if(string === "yes"){
            //     return "drink coffee"
            //     } else if(string === "no") {
            //     return "keep working"
            //     }
            // }

// Write the test for a function that returns "relax" if you are stressed and "keep going" if you are not stressed.

    //     describe("areYouStressed", () => {
    //     it("returns relax or keep going based on input", () => {
    //     expect(areYouStressed("yes")).toEqual("relax")
    //     expect(areYouStressed("no")).toEqual("keep going")
    //     })
    // })

// Write the function that will make the test pass.

    //     const areYouStressed = (string) => {
    //     if (string === "yes") {
    //     return "relax"
    //     } else if (string === "no") {
    //     return "keep going"    
    //     }
    // }

// Write the function that will make the test pass.
// Write the test for a function called divisibleBy that takes two numbers as arguments and returns whether the first number is evenly divisible by the second so that divisibleBy(10, 5) logs "10 is evenly divisible by 5".
// Write the function that will make the test pass.
// Write the test for a function called fizzbuzz. If a number is a multiple of 3, replace it with the word 'fizz'. If a number is a multiple of five, replace it with the word 'buzz'. If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, replace it with 'fizzbuzz'.
// Write the function that will make the test pass.
